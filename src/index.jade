        h1 That's a lot of versions to juggle

      section
        h2 At one point
        h3 I was doing the majority of the work.

      section
        h3 In January of 2017 I did my first release of Node.js
        h2 Node.js v4.2.5

      section
        h3 I proceeded to release
        h2 27 of the next 30 releases
        h3 of Node.js version 4.x

      section
        h3 I then became the primary release manager
        h2 For Node.js 6.x LTS
        h3 Releasing 25 of the 32 LTS releases

      section(data-bespoke-backdrop='burn-out')
        h3 This was not sustainable
        h2 I was burning out

      section
        h2 I had also switched jobs
        h3 Not as much time during work hours to dedicate to releases

      section
        h3 By the end of 2017 I was still doing ~60% of all releases in the project
        h2 I was going for a promotion at work
        h3 I could not sustain my current involvement

      section
        h3 I nominated another collaborator to be the release lead for the v8.x LTS
        h4 I began working with them to better document and automate our process
        h3 There was a light at the end of the tunnel

      section
        h1 This plan didn't work out

      section(data-bespoke-backdrop='life')

      section
        h3 In May of 2018
        h2 I announced that I would step down from the release team in 6 months
        h3 the plan was to nominate and train 3 new members

      section
        h4 Spoiler Alert: I'm still on the team ðŸ˜…

      section(data-bespoke-backdrop='failure')
        h1 No Single Points of Failure

      section
        h3 Through 2018 and early 2019
        h2 I mentored 2 new LTS releasers

      section
        h3 I also invested more time in improving policy and tooling
        h2 based on feedback of new team members

      section
        h3 We made it easier to onboard folks
        h2 We added 4 new releasers
        h3 Between Mid-2018 and Late-2019

      section
        h3 I did 45% of all project releases in 2018
        h2 I did 15% of all project releases in 2019
        h3 I've continued to do around 15% of releases since

      section
        h1 You can't do everything yourself

      section
        h3 If your process isn't documented others can't help you
        h2 In ambiguous situations most people won't do anything
        h3 Especially if they are not established leaders in a project

      section
        h3 Software Releases are the quickest path
        h2 To intimate knowledge
        h3 of how your project works

      section
        h3 If you want to change the representation in your project
        h2 Mentoring diverse releasers
        h3 Is a fantastic way to make measurable change

      section
        h3 Release work is work
        h2 Make sure people are benefiting from this labor
        h3 This does not need to be financial (but it helps)

      section
        h3 Take care of yourself
        h2 There is only one of you

      section
        h2 Thank You
